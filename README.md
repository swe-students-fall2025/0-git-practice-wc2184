I really like [Don’t Ask to Ask](https://dontasktoask.com/).  

It’s a short piece about why it’s better to just ask your question directly instead of asking if you can ask. I like it because it shows how asking a precursory “can I ask a question?” puts the responsibility on the other person to engage, which most people won’t do. That insight hit me hard—it made me realize why a lot of my vague or indirect questions weren’t getting answers. Being straightforward actually increases the chances of someone helping. It also made me more introspective and aware of how I frame and ask for things and to be more mindful of it, especially when something innocent like asking "if there are any Java experts here" can result poorly for me.

@xl4624: Another article similar to this is [no hello](https://nohello.net/en/), which is a website that serves essentially the same purpose (but maybe not really software related) as a resource you can share with people that aren't familiar with this. It's a good reminder to be considerate of other people's time and to be thoughtful in how you communicate. Being clear, concise, and efficient keeps conversations focused and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.
